# ðŸ§± LLD Practice Projects

This repository contains clean and modular **Low-Level Design (LLD)** implementations based on real-world interview patterns.  
Each project is built using **SOLID principles** and demonstrates good object-oriented design.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. [Parking Lot System](./ParkingLot)

Implements a basic object-oriented Parking System using good class design, enums, and strategies.

- **Concepts:** Class hierarchy, encapsulation, modularity  
- **Techniques:** Enums, vehicle types, and slot logic

## ðŸš€ How to Run

All projects are written in **C++** and tested using **CLion** IDE.  
You can also compile individual `main.cpp` files manually using:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o output && ./output
